The Agricultural Chatbot is an intelligent NLP-based model designed to assist with agriculture-related queries such as crop storage management, soil health, fertilizer use, and pest control. It is built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network that understands and generates context-aware responses. The model aims to support farmers and agricultural students by providing reliable and relevant information for better decision-making in farming practices.
